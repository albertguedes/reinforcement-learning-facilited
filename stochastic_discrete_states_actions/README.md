# STOCHASTIC DISCRETE STATES AND ACTIONS

Reinforcemant Learning technics to solve problems with discrete action and states, but, stochastic states from actions.

- environment_tables.py : here you define the problem to be solved with the algorithms.
- environment.py : a class to manage the tables.
- action_value.py : script to solve using action-values approach.
- state_value.py : script to solve using state-values approach.

All solutions utilize python 3.7.3 and torch 1.8.1+cpu.
